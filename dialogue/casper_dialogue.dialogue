Casper: [#mood=bored] So, I heard them say you have amnesia.
Casper: [#mood=bored] Is that true?
Christina: [#mood=default] Yeah... are you also one of my friends?
Casper: [#mood=bored] I wouldn't say friend, more so...
Casper: [#mood=bored] two people who know each other enough to have a normal 
	conversation, but not enough to keep the conversation going, 
	because you barely know them in the first place.
Christina: [#mood=wut] Wow... that's a mouthful.
Casper: [#mood=bored] The name is Casper.
Casper: [#mood=bored] That's. Casper with a "C"
Casper: [#mood=bored] Or, you could refer to me by my full name.
Casper: [#mood=bored] Casper Elliot Alexander Atticus Grant the Second.
Christina: [#mood=wut] ...
Christina: [#mood=default] I think I'll stick with Casper.
Casper: [#mood=bored] They always do.
Christina: [#mood=default] So, why weren't you in the dining area with the others?
Casper: [#mood=bored] I don't like to associate myself with them.
Casper: [#mood=bored] I just like to be left alone with my books.
Christina: [#mood=confused] Then, how did you know I had amnesia?
Casper: [#mood=bored] The walls here are really thin.
Casper: [#mood=bored] So thin, that you can easily eavesdrop on their conversations.
Casper: [#mood=bored] You should try it.
Casper: [#mood=bored] They say the best place to eavesdrop is by the windows.
Casper: [#mood=bored] Just, try not to get caught while you do it.
Christina: [#mood=thinking] O... k?
Casper: [#mood=bored] And one more thing.
Casper: [#mood=bored] Don't go into the woods at night.
Casper: [#mood=bored] You might get lost.
Christina: [#mood=default] I... wasn't planning on to.
Casper: [#mood=bored] As you should.
