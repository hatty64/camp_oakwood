Barley: [#mood=default] You really don't remember a thing, huh?
Barley: [#mood=worried] This is not good.
Barley: [#mood=smile] Well, since you don't remember a thing, I guess I'll get you up to speed.
Barley: [#mood=smile] My name is Barley, I am your father
Barley: [#mood=smile] and you are Christina, my daughter.

Barley: [#mood=default] Do you remember what happened?

Christina: [#mood=thinking] No... not a clue.

Ester: [#mood=worried] I'm so glad you're ok!
Ester: [#mood=worried] Barley said you lost your memory... is that true?
Christina: [#mood=thinking] I don't remember anything, so... yes?
Ester: [#mood=smile] I see... well, my name is Ester, one of your camp counselors.
Ester: [#mood=default] Do you have any injuries I need to know about?
Christina: [#mood=thinking] I don't... feel any pain, so I guess not.
Ester: [#mood=smile] Ok, that's good.
Barley: [#mood=default] So, do you know exactly what happened this morning?

Ester: [#mood=thinking] Well, we were just taking our usual morning hikes around the woods, until I heard a loud noise coming from a distance.
Ester: [#mood=default] That's when I realized Christina was missing.
Ester: [#mood=worried] I don't know exactly what happened to her, but what I do know is that I should've been more vigilant.
Ester: [#mood=worried] I'm sorry... I promise I'll do better next time.
Barley: [#mood=smile] It's okay Ester, we all make mistakes.
Barley: [#mood=default] But keep an eye on the others, we don't want to lose any more campers.
Barley: [#mood=default] Now, let's let Christina rest for a few minutes.
