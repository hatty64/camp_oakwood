	Christina: [#chr=christina] [#mood=smile] Well, they were relieved to see me.
	Christina: [#chr=christina] [#mood=thinking] But then they panicked when I told them I had amnesia.
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=bored] Figures.
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=default] Let's hope your memories return before summer ends.
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=smug] You don't wanna go back to school with an empty head.
	Christina: [#chr=christina] [#mood=confused] What?
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=bored] Nevermind.

	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=default] You'll find him in his office.

	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=default] Just follow the path to the lake, go right and then go up,
		you'll find him there.
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=default] got it?
	Christina: [#chr=christina] [#mood=default] ...
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=bored] (Sigh)
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=bored] Y'know what, here's a map, you'll find Barley's office there.
	You got a map!
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=default] If you have any questions, just let me know.
	Christina: [#chr=christina] [#mood=confused] Why is the bottom-left part of the map torn?
	Clancy: [#chr=clancy] [#mood=bored] that's enough questions.
