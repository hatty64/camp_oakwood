Clancy: [#mood=default] Oh, you're awake.
Clancy: [#mood=default] I was just about to check up on you.
Clancy: [#mood=default] So, how are you feeling?
Clancy: [#mood=bored] No brain damage or anything?

Christina: [#mood=thinking] No... I don't think so... who are you?

Clancy: [#mood=default] Right... your memories...
Clancy: [#mood=default] I'm Clancy, one of your camp counselors.

Christina: [#mood=confused] Can you tell me where I am?

Clancy: [#mood=bored] You're in Camp Oakwood, the best place to spend your summer...

Christina: [#mood=default] You don't sound very excited.

Clancy: [#mood=bored] Well, when you're forced to stay here for four weeks with no pay, why would you?

Christina: [#mood=confused] Is it that bad?

Clancy: [#mood=bored] You have no idea...
Clancy: [#mood=default] Anyways, your friends are waiting for you in the dining area.
Clancy: [#mood=default] just follow the dirt path to the camp, I'll see you there.
Clancy: [#mood=bored] If you need anything... ask someone else.
