	Christina: [#chr=christina] [#mood=default] Did you know there's a cat on your desk?
	Librarian: He's my... emotional support.
	Librarian: I take him wherever I go.
	Librarian: Apart from the shower... or the bathroom.
	Librarian: His name is Spot.
	Christina: [#chr=christina] [#mood=happy] Aaww, That's adorable.
	Librarian: You can... pet him if you want.
	Librarian: (Yawn) don't worry... he doesn't bite.
